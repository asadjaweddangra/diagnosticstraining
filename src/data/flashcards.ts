  ultrasound: [
    { front: "What happens to resolution when frequency increases?", back: "Resolution improves, penetration decreases. Use higher frequency for superficial structures." },
    { front: "When to use a curved array probe?", back: "Deep abdominal imaging with wide field of view; 2–5 MHz for penetration." },
    { front: "Depth control does what?", back: "Sets how deep you scan and scales the image to frame the target with margin." },
    { front: "What does TGC adjust?", back: "Depth-specific brightness to compensate for attenuation." },
    { front: "Doppler color mnemonic?", back: "BART: Blue Away, Red Toward." },

    { front: "Where is the gallbladder?", back: "Right upper quadrant, attached under the liver." },
    { front: "Name the 4 heart chambers.", back: "RA, RV, LA, LV." },
    { front: "What does the P wave represent?", back: "Atrial depolarization (contraction)." },

    { front: "Where are V1 and V2 placed?", back: "4th intercostal space, right/left sternal borders." },
    { front: "How to find 4th intercostal space?", back: "Find sternal angle (2nd ICS) then count down to 4th." },

  safety: [
    { front: "What is ALARA?", back: "As Low As Reasonably Achievable – minimal exposure for diagnostic images." },
